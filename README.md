## Synopsis

This game is a homage to the 1982 cult classic, Tron. It recreates the light cycle matches that are played out during the movie. It currently supports 2 players.
The object of the game is to stay alive the longest by not crashing into the walls, the opponent's trail, or your own trail.

## Motivation

Learning to code + nostalgia = a winning combination

## Installation

Python 3 is required! No other external modules are needed.

```bash

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/reeses-pieces/tron.git

# Run main.py to start.
python3 main.py

```

## Known issues
- Mac required (afplay) for audio to work correctly
- Collision detection is dodgy at higher lightcycle speeds.
