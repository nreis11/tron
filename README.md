## Synopsis

This game is a homage to the 1982 cult classic, Tron. It recreates the light cycle battles that are played out during the movie. It currently supports 1-2 human players and 0-3 bots.
The object of the game is to stay alive the longest by not crashing into the walls, the opponent's trail, or your own trail.
